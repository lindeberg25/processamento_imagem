# processamento_imagem

For this project, the student's personal photo (foto_lindeberg.jpeg) with 1024x1024 resolution is used. The photo is converted to gray levels, according to the composition Y = 0.30 R + 0.55 G + 0.15 B. In addition, for each image (original or result), the image with its spectrum centered on log | z | is always shown. The commented source code (Trabalho2.ipynb) and a html-generated version for quick viewing (Trabalho2.html) are available
